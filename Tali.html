		<h1>Talibanization</h1>
		<p>When the Taliban entered my valley, I was ten years old. They were dark-skinned and wore black turbans. My father described them as
		"people deprived of baths and barbers." They also wore black badges (Yousafzai 111).</p><br/>

		<p>The leader of this taliban group was Maulana Fazlullah, or Mullah Fazlullah. He claimed himself as a wise scholar who knows about Islamic law
		when in reality he is a high school dropout. Through the illegal radio stations he built, Fazlullah conveyed information on how to live, like how to pray and no using
		tobacco, heroin, or <i>char</i> (hashish). His deputy Shah Douran warned that listening to music, watching movies, and dancing would bring 
		Allah's wrath back into Mingora (Yousafzai 111-113).</p><br/><br/>

		<p>Fazlullah and his group destroyed every trace of art as it was deemed "un-Islamic." They destroyed the face of the Jehanabad Buddha
		and stupas that were thousands of years old. They also banned women and girls from going outside, and banned Carrom, a board game.<br/>
		Just like this, Fazlullah and his group were able to control 59 villages while the authorities did nothing because they were intimidated by
		Fazlullah. They also confiscated CD's and DVD's and burned them in colossal bonfires (Yousafzai 113, 123-125).</p><br/>
