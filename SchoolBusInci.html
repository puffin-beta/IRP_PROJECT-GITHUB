		<h1>The School Bus Incident</h1>
		<p>After we finished a Pakistan histories test, my class was dismissed at 12:00 P.M. Me and my friends rushed to the front door and into the 
		<i>dyna</i>, which was like a bus. The city was packed, lively, and smelled putrid. However, we were used to the smell (Yousafzai 239-240).</p><br/>

		<p>The dyna turned right from the main road onto a side road toward an army checkpoint. All of us were chatting and singing.
		Just then two men blocked the dyna, forcing it to a screeching halt. That's when a man with a peaked hat hung on the back of the dyna
		and demanded "Who is Malala!" Several of the girls looked at me.</p>
		<p>The man pulled out a black pistol, a Colt .45. Some of the girls screamed. The man fired three shots in a row. The first went through my 
		left eye socket and out my left shoulder. The second through Shazia's left hand. The third through the left shoulder and out the upper right 
		arm of Kainat Riaz (Yousafzai 9, 241-242).</p><br/>

		<p>After what just happened, I was rushed to a hospital, where the desparity of the situation was realized. I was escorted to a helipad by ambulance
		and to Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, Paksitan, by helicopter. There, a neurosurgeon named Colonial Juniad examined me and took a
		CT scan. The scan revealed that my injury was a lot more serious than what the doctors at Swat valley told. Juniad claimed that he has treated
		"thousands of Malalas" (Yousafzai 245-252).</p>
		<p>Since the bullet fractured parts of my skull, fragments of it entered my brain. The only way I can survive that moment was to operate
		to get the fragments and part of my skull out. My father was reluctant, but agreed as this was the only way I could survive. My operation
		lasted from 1:30 A.M. to 5:30 A.M. The surgeons conducted a series of delicate procedures to remove fragments of bone and relocating them.
		During this time, my father was terrified. He kept asking if I would survive (Yousafzai 254-255).</p>
		<p><strong>"In medicine two plus two does not always make four" (Yousafzai 256), </strong>Juniad replied.</p><br/>

		<p>I was escored to Rawalpandi to be treated further and then abroad to Birmingham to be treated by Dr. Fiona. The news of my shooting had
		spread like wildfire, with President Obama and UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon criticizing the event. Other news stations
		created fake news about me and even questioned my shooting (Yousafzai 263-265, 270-271)!</p>
